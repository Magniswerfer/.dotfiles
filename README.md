My NixOS configuration and home-manager files

I've done all this following [LibrePhoenix'](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix) videos which are awesome!

## TODO
[] - Make an install script like LibrePhoenix', that will dynamically adapt this to different hardware setups
[] - Figure out how to manage different computers and git -- maybe using branches or conditionals in the config-files...
